# Problem Description


## What would the result be?

An application to decide where to move your family and live based not only on the cost of housing, but also on
* opportunities for yourself
* opportunities for your immediate family (spouse, parents)
* fueling your childrens' ambitions and creating opportunities for them

## What is available now?

At the moment, when you want to move your family, say to a particular city or county in the Bay area, cost of living immediately comes to mind. One goes through websites like Craigslist to find houses that fit their requirements (size) and budget (rent) or when one wants to permanently relocate to an area one would look at websites like [Redfin](https://www.redfin.com/) or Zillow to find houses that fit their requirements (size, school district, etc.) and budget (home prices). Besides ratings of different schools in the area, they also provide detailed history of the property itself, detailing when it was built, renovated, what kind of heating it has, an estimate of monthly mortgage payments, etc. Further, one could filter the houses based on several of these parameters to narrow down one's search.

## What is not available now?

But all of these websites, though they are geared towards catering to the needs of customers main interests (school quality for their kids, price, etc.) they hardly cater to the needs of the individuals. Of course, they might advertise the house being closer to "Silicon Valley tech companies" or "Apple's Spaceship", but if you are a family trying to work several jobs to make ends meet, it doesn't provide you how many restaurants or grocery stores are nearby where family members could work part-time during the evenings to provide for one's family.
