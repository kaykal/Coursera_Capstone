## Data Sources and Data Description

### Data Sources

The problem we are trying to solve involves data gathering from a variety of sources. The main challenge and handicap of all of the current websites is that not all the information is present in one dashboard or platform for the family head of our fictitious family to filter and narrow his search. We will primarily use two main sources of data and mention a third one (which is not being used in this project, but was analyzed and the analysis would be presented in the final presentation). The main sources of data we would be using in this project includes:

  * Home prices (of "current" listings) from [Redfin](https://www.redfin.com/)
  * Venue data from [Foursquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/api-reference/venues/categories/)
  * California School data from [CA School Dashboard](https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/cm/#)
